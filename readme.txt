# 🔷 Smart Energy & Utility Management System

This project is a **modular, feature-based system** developed by a team.  
Each feature is built **separately** and later **integrated into the main application**.

The goal is to maintain **clean architecture, parallel development, and easy integration**.

## 🧩 Feature Details

### 🔹 Feature 1: Smart Electricity Estimation & Optimization
- Predicts monthly electricity consumption and bill amount
- User inputs: house type, appliances, usage hours, conditions
- Technologies:
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Backend: Python Flask
  - ML: Regression-based prediction model

---

### 🔹 Feature 2: Utility / Energy Related Module
- Developed as a standalone feature
- Handles specific energy/utility functionality
- Can run independently without other modules

---

### 🔹 Feature 3: Data Processing & Analysis Feature
- Focuses on data handling and logic processing
- Designed to be reused during final integration
- Independent backend logic

---

### 🔹 Feature 4: Smart Clarification Chatbot
- Explains outputs in simple and user-friendly language
- Rule-based chatbot (No ML for transparency)
- Improves user understanding and trust
- Built using HTML, JavaScript, and Flask

## 🛠️ Development Strategy

✔ Each feature is developed **separately**  
✔ Team members worked on **individual modules**  
✔ No tight dependency between features during development  

This approach helps in:
- Faster development
- Easy debugging
- Clean code separation
- Better teamwork

---

## 🔗 Integration Plan

- All features are **designed to be integrated** into a single main system
- Integration will include:
  - Common Flask backend
  - Unified dashboard-style frontend
  - Centralized data flow

> 📌 Final integration will be done in the **main application** after feature-level completion.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains:
- Feature-wise implementation
- Tested individual modules
- Code ready for main integration

The **main project** will combine all features into a complete system.
